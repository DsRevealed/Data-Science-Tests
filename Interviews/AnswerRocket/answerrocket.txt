Forecast sales for the next 12 months

Based on the data, create a forecast for 2020 sales across each category.

Starting in April of 2020, show the predicted effects of the Federal Covid economic stimulus by including an additional food sales rise of 10%, drink sales rise of 5%, and dessert sales fall of -5%.  

For months after April, model half as much impact as the prior month. Write a generalizable function that takes in your forecast dataframe, the month and year of the stimulus, and the % effect on each category. The function will return the adjusted forecast dataframe.
